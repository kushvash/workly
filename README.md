The platform enables teams to collaborate seamlessly in real-time, improving communication and task management efficiency.

Features
	•	Daily Task Tracking
	•	Create, edit, and delete tasks with real-time updates.
	•	Get notified instantly when team members complete tasks.
	•	Pomodoro Timer
	•	Integrated timer to help users stay focused with structured work and break sessions.
	•	Visual cues and responsive design for enhanced usability.
	•	Team Online Status & Notifications
	•	Real-time updates of team members’ online status using WebSockets.
	•	Instant notifications for task completions and incoming calls.
	•	Video Call via Email
	•	Initiate video calls by entering a teammate’s email.
	•	Receive incoming call notifications with accept/reject options.
	•	Establish peer-to-peer video connections using WebRTC with robust ICE candidate handling.

Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
	•	Real-time Communication: Socket.io (WebSockets) for live updates and notifications
	•	Video Calling: WebRTC for peer-to-peer video streams with STUN servers for NAT traversal
	•	Database & Authentication: Firebase for user authentication and real-time data storage
	•	Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)

Technical Challenges & Solutions
	•	Real-time Data Synchronization
Achieved seamless real-time communication with Socket.io, ensuring that task updates, team statuses, and video call signals propagate instantly across all users.
	•	WebRTC Signaling
Implemented a robust signaling system to handle offer/answer exchanges and ICE candidates, ensuring stable peer-to-peer video connections even behind NATs.
	•	User-friendly Video Calls
Replaced traditional room-based calls with an email-based calling system, making the process more intuitive for users. Calls come with an incoming call notification allowing users to accept or reject calls conveniently.
	•	Responsive UI/UX
Leveraged Tailwind CSS to build a clean, responsive interface that works seamlessly on desktops and mobile devices.

How to Use
	1.	Sign Up / Log In via Firebase Authentication.
	2.	View Team Status: Instantly see who’s online.
	3.	Manage Tasks: Add new tasks, track progress, and receive real-time updates.
	4.	Use the Pomodoro Timer: Stay productive with structured work intervals.
	5.	Start a Video Call:
	•	Enter a Room Id and click on "Start Call".
    	•	The call starts as soon as the other user enters the room.

Lessons Learned & Key Takeaways
	•	Mastered real-time communication with WebSockets and WebRTC, including managing edge cases like ICE candidate queuing and network traversal issues.
	•	Improved understanding of peer-to-peer connections and the signaling process required to establish stable WebRTC connections.
	•	Enhanced skills in frontend state management and ensuring smooth UX during complex workflows like incoming calls and live task updates.
	•	Gained hands-on experience with Firebase Authentication and deploying full-stack applications using Vercel and Render.

Future Improvements
	•	Improve ICE candidate handling to ensure faster connection times.
	•	Add audio notifications for incoming calls and task completions.
	•	Enhance mobile responsiveness and add dark mode support.
	•	Record video calls and save them to Firebase Storage for future reference.
